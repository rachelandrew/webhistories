The Web Histories project is an attempt to document the stories of those who have helped to shape the open web platform, 
with a focus on those people who are often underrepresented in the formal histories.

While some of the names that appear here may be familiar to you, some may not. 
Yet all of these people played a part in shaping the web we have today.
