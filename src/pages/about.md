I'm [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew), a web developer, writer, and speaker from the UK.

This project is my production dissertation project for the MA in International Journalism at Napier University. 
However, I have wanted to write about this subject for a number of years. 
Having a dissertation to submit provided me with a deadline.

My aim is that the project can have a lifespan past that of the dissertation itself. 
I've chosen to deploy it as static files in order that no infrastructure is needed to host it.  
I am developing the site in such a way to make it easy for others to contribute in future, 
in order that we can continue to tell these stories.

Thanks to Andy Bell and his [Hylia Starter kit](https://hylia.website/) for making it easy to get this holding site up!
