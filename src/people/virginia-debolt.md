Virginia DeBolt is an educator and tech writer who wrote books which were the first to teach HTML and CSS as an integrated method. 
She believed that HTML and CSS should be taught simultaneously, 
rather than teaching HTML first, then asking students to forget all about font tags and learn CSS.

She was involved in creating the WaSP InterACT curriculum, 
an initiative of the WaSP Education Task Force. 
The curriculum was licensed to the W3C in 2012.
